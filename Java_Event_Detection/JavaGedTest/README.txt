This dir contains several test examples of ged

1. AND
	
	This demonstrated how to define a global primitive event, 
	a global composite event (AND),a rule, and how to raise an 	
	event.

2. OR

	This demonstrated how to define a global primitive event, 
	a global composite event (OR),a rule, and how to raise an 	
	event.

3. SEQ

	This demonstrated how to define a global primitive event, 
	a global composite event (SEQ),a rule, and how to raise an 	
	event.

4. NOT_1

	This demonstrated how to define a global primitive event, 
	a global composite event (NOT),a rule, and how to raise an 	
	event.

	The not event will be detected on local site

5. NOT_2

	This demonstrated how to define a global primitive event, 
	a global composite event (NOT),a rule, and how to raise an 	
	event.

	The not event will be detected on server and producer site

6. ged_makefits_demo

	The demo shows how to apply ged to track applications. 
	There are two track domains. One for ships and aircrafts. 
	The control center can subscribe to the events of interest
	from the remote site.
